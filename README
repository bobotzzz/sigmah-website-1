Presentation
------------

Sigmah website GitHub project is a project following the evolution of the code
of the Sigmah Drupal website.

Sigmah is Humanitarian Project Management Open Source Software.

You can see the production version of this website at: http://www.sigmah.org/


How to start ?
--------------
1. Install locally a PHP/MySQL server (like http://www.easyphp.org/).
2. Create a database "sigmah_website" accessible from the user 'root' in your
  MySQL database.
3. Create an Apache alias named "sigmah-website" to your local copy of the 
  content of this Git repo.
4. Open in your web browser the URL pointing to this alias 
  (like http://127.0.0.1:8000/sigmah-website/, but it depends on your local
  Apache server config).
5. Log on to the website with the login/password "user3"/"sigmah" to log on with
  a user account which has all privileges.
=> You're in !

For information: all user accounts have "sigmah" as password.
